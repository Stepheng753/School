<b>Abstract.</b> First-order difference equations arise in many contexts
in the biological, economic and social sciences. 
Such equations, even though simple and deterministic, can exhibit a
surprising array of dynamical 
behaviour, from stable points, to a bifurcating hierarchy of stable
cycles, to apparently random 
fluctuations. There are consequently many fascinating problems, some
concerned with delicate 
mathematical aspects of. the fine structure of the trajectories, and
some concerned with the practical 
implications and applications. This is an interpretive review of them.

<title>Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics -
R.M. May</title>




</p><p>
</p><h3>1. INTROUCTION</h3>
<p align="justify">
There are many situations, in many disciplines, which can be 
described, at least to a crude first approximation, by a simple
first-order difference equation. Studies of the dynamical
properties of such models usually consist of finding constant
equilibrium solutions, and then conducting a linearised analysis
to determine their stability with respect to small disturbances:
explicitly nonlinear dynamical features are usually not
considered.

</p><p align="justify">
Recent studies have, however, shown that the very simplest
nonlinear difference equations can possess an extraordinarily
rich spectrum of dynamical behaviour, from stable points,
through cascades of stable cycles, to a regime in which the
behaviour (although fully deterministic) is in many respects
"chaotic", or indistinguishable from the sample function of a
random process.

</p><p>
This review article has several aims.

</p><p align="justify">
First, although the main features of these nonlinear 
phenomena have been discovered and independently rediscovered by
several people, I know of no source where all the main results
are collected together. I have therefore tried to give such a
synoptic account. This is done in a brief and descriptive way,
and includes some new material: the detailed mathematical
proofs are to be found in the technical literature, to which
signposts are given.

</p><p align="justify">
Second, I indicate some of the interesting mathematical
questions which do not seem to be fully resolved, Some of these
problems are of a practical kind, to do with providing a 
probabilistic desciiption for trajectories which seem random, even
though their underlying structure is deterministic. Other
problems are of intrinsic mathematical interest, and treat such
things as the pathology of the bifurcation structure, or the truly
random behaviour, that can arise when the nonlinear function
<i>F(X)</i> of equation (1) is not analytical. One aim here is to stimulate
research on these questions, particularly on the empirical
questions which relate to processing data.

</p><p align="justify">
Third, consideration is given to some fields where these
notions may find practical application. Such applications range
from the abstractly metaphorical (where, for example, the
transition from a stable point to "chaos" serves as a metaphor
for the onset of turbulence in a fluid), to models for the dynamic
behaviour of biological populations (where one can seek to use
field or laboratory data to estimate the values of the parameters
in the difference equation).

</p><p align="justify">
Fourth, there is a very brief review of the literature pertaining
to the way this spectrum of behaviour - stable points, stable
cycles, chaos - can arise in second or higher order difference
equations (that is, two or more dimensions; two or more
interacting species), where the onset of chaos usually requires
less severe nonlinearities. Differential equations are also
surveyed in this light; it seems that a three-dimensional system
of first-order ordinary differential equations is required for the
manifestation of chaotic behaviour.

</p><p align="justify">
The review ends with an evangelical plea for the introduction
of these difference equations into elementary mathematics
courses, so that students' intuition may be enriched by seeing
the wild things that simple nonlinear equations can do.

<title>Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics -
R.M. May</title>




</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>2. FIRST-ORDER DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS</h3>
<p align="justify">
One of the simplest systems an ecologist can study is a seasonally 
breeding population in which generations do not overlap
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#1" target="ads_dw">1</a> -
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#4" target="ads_dw">4</a></sup>.
Many natural populations, particularly among temperate zone
insects (including many economically important crop and
orchard pests), are of this kind, In this situation, the 
observational data will usually consist of information about 
the maximum, or the average, or the total population in each
generation. The theoretician seeks to understand how the
magnitude of the population in generation <i>t</i>+1,
<i>X</i><sub>t+1</sub>, is 
related to the magnitude of the population in the preceding
generation <i>t, X</i><sub>t</sub>: such a relationship may be expressed
in the general form

</p><p>
</p><center>
<i>X</i><sub>t+1</sub> = <i>F</i>(<i>X</i><sub>t</sub>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
</center>

<p align="justify">
The function <i>F(X)</i> will usually be what a biologist calls "density
dependent", and a mathematician calls nonlinear; equation (1) is
then a first-order, nonlinear difference equation.

</p><p align="justify">
Although I shall henceforth adopt the habit of referring to the
variable <i>X</i> as "the population", there are countless situations
outside population biology where the basic equation (1),
applies. There are other examples in biology, as, for example
in genetics <sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#5" target="ads_dw">5</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#6" target="ads_dw">6</a></sup>
(where the equation describes the change in gene
frequency in time) or in epidemiology
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#7" target="ads_dw">7</a></sup> (with
<i>X</i> the fraction of 
the population infected at time <i>t</i>). Examples in economics
include models for the relationship between commodity
quantity and price
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#8" target="ads_dw">8</a></sup>, for the
theory of business cycles
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#9" target="ads_dw">9</a></sup>, and for
the temporal sequences generated by various other economic
quantities <sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#10" target="ads_dw">10</a></sup>.
The general equation (1) also is germane to the social sciences
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#11" target="ads_dw">11</a></sup>,
where it arises, for example, in theories of
learning (where <i>X</i> may be the number of bits of information that
can be remembered after an interval <i>t</i>), or in the propagation of
rumours in variously structured societies (where <i>X</i> is the
number of people to have heard the rumour after time <i>t</i>). The
imaginative reader will be able to invent other contexts for
equation (1).

</p><p align="justify">
In many of these contexts, and for biological populations in
particular, there is a tendency for the variable <i>X</i> to increase
from one generation to the next when it is small, and for it to
decrease when it is large. That is, the nonlinear function <i>F(X)</i>
often has the following properties: <i>F</i>(0)=0; <i>F(X)</i> increases
monotonically as <i>X</i> increases through the range 0 &lt; <i>X &lt; A</i>
(with <i>F(X)</i> attaining its maximum value at <i>X = A</i>); and
<i>F(X)</i> 
decreases monotonically as <i>X</i> increases beyond <i>X = A</i>. 
Moreover, <i>F(X)</i> will usually contain one or more parameters which
"tune" the severity of this nonlinear behaviour; parameters
which tune the steepness of the hump in the <i>F(X)</i> curve. These
parameters will typically have some biological or economic or
sociological significance.

</p><p align="justify">
A specific example is afforded by the equation
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#1" target="ads_dw">1</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#4" target="ads_dw">4</a>,

<i>N</i><sub>t+1</sub> = <i>N</i><sub>t</sub> (<i>a</i> - <i>b</i>
<i>N</i><sub>t</sub>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
</center>

<p align="justify">
This is sometimes called the "logistic" difference equation. In
the limit <i>b</i> = 0, it describes a population growing purely 
exponentially (for <i>a</i> &gt; 1); for <i>b</i>
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/neq.gif" alt="neq"> 0, the quadratic nonlinearity 
produces a growth curve with a hump, the steepness of which is
tuned by the parameter <i>a</i>. By writing <i>X = bN/a</i>, the
equation may be brought into canonical form
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#1" target="ads_dw">1</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#4" target="ads_dw">4</a>,

<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#23" target="ads_dw">23</a></sup>

</p><p>
</p><center>
<i>X</i><sub>t+1</sub> = <i>a</i><i>X</i><sub>t</sub> (1 -
<i>X</i><sub>t</sub>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
</center>

<p align="justify">
In this form, which is illustrated in <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%201">Fig. 1</a>, it
is arguably the 
simplest nonlinear difference equation. I shall use equation (3)
for most of the numerical examples and illustrations in this
article. Although attractive to mathematicians by virtue of its
extreme simplicity, in practical applications equation (3) has the
disadvantage that it requires <i>X</i> to remain on the interval
0 &lt; <i>X</i> &lt; 1; if <i>X</i> ever exceeds unity, subsequent iterations
diverge 
towards - <img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/infty.gif" alt="infty"> (which means the
population becomes extinct). 
Furthermore, <i>F(X)</i> in equation (3) attains a maximum value of
<i>a</i>/4 (at <i>X</i> = 1/2); the equation therefore possesses non-trivial
dynamical behaviour only if <i>a</i> &lt; 4. On the other hand, all
trajectories are attracted to <i>X</i> = 0 if <i>a</i> &lt; 1. Thus for
non-trivial dynamical behaviour we require 1 &lt; <i>a</i> &lt; 4; failing
this, the population becomes extinct.

<p align="justify">
This again describes a population with a propensity to simple
exponential growth at low densities, and a tendency to decrease
at high densities. The steepness of this nonlinear behaviour is
tuned by the parameter <i>r</i>. The model is plausible for a single
species population which is regulated by an epidemic disease at
high density <sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#28" target="ads_dw">28</a></sup>.
The function <i>F(X)</i> of equation (4) is slightly more 
complicated than that of equation (3), but has the compensating
advantage that local stability implies global stability<sup>1</sup> for all
<i>X</i> &gt; 0.

</p><p align="justify">
The forms (3) and (4) by no means exhaust the list of single-humped 
functions <i>F(X)</i> for equation (1) which can be culled
from the ecological literature. A fairly full such catalogue is
given, complete with references, by May and Oster
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#1" target="ads_dw">1</a></sup>. Other similar
mathematical functions are given by Metropolis et al.
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#16" target="ads_dw">16</a></sup>. Yet
other forms for <i>F(X)</i> are discussed under the heading of
"mathematical curiosities" below.

<title>Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics -
R.M. May</title>




</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>3. DYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF EQUATION (1)</h3>
<p align="justify">
Possible constant, equilibrium values (or "fixed points") of <i>X</i> in
equation (1) may be found algebraically by putting
<i>X</i><sub>t+1</sub> = <i>X</i><sub>t</sub> = 
<i>X</i>*, and solving the resulting equation

</p><p>
</p><center>
<i>X</i>* = <i>F</i>(<i>X</i>*)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)
</center>

<p align="justify">
An equivalent graphical method is to find the points where the
curve <i>F(X)</i> that maps <i>X</i><sub>t</sub> into
<i>X</i><sub>t+1</sub> intersects the 45° line, 
<i>X</i><sub>t+1</sub> = <i>X</i><sub>t</sub> which corresponds to the
ideal nirvana of zero 
population growth; see <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May2.html#Figure%201">Fig. 1</a>. For the
single-hump curves 
discussed above, and exemplified by equations (3) and (4), there
are two such points: the trivial solution <i>X</i> = 0, and a non-trivial
solution <i>X</i>* (which for equation (3) is <i>X</i>* = 1 - (1/<i>a</i>).

</p><p align="justify">
The next question concerns the stability of the equilibrium
point <i>X</i>*. This can be seen
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#24" target="ads_dw">24</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#25" target="ads_dw">25</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#19" target="ads_dw">19</a> -
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#21" target="ads_dw">21</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#1" target="ads_dw">1</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#4" target="ads_dw">4</a></sup> to depend on the slope
of the <i>F(X)</i> curve at <i>X</i>*. This slope, which is illustrated
by the dashed lines in <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May2.html#Figure%201">Fig. 1</a>, can be
designated 

</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda">(<i>X</i>*) = [d<i>F</i> /
d<i>X</i>]<sub>x = x*</sub>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)
</center>

<p align="justify">
So long as this slope lies between 45° and  -45° (that is,
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(1)</sup>
between +1 and  -1), making an acute angle with the 45° ZPG
line, the equilibrium point <i>X</i>* will be at least locally stable,
attracting all trajectories in its neighbourhood. In equation (3),
for example, this slope is
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(1)</sup> = 2 -
<i>a</i>: the equilibrium point is 
therefore stable, and attracts all trajectories originating in the
interval 0 &lt; <i>X</i> &lt; 1, if and only if 1 &lt; <i>a</i> &lt; 3.

</p><p align="justify">
As the relevant parameters are tuned so that the curve <i>F(X)</i>
becomes more and more steeply humped, this stability-determining 
slope at <i>X</i>* may eventually steepen beyond  -45° (that is,
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(1)</sup> &lt; -1),
whereupon the equilibrium point <i>X</i>* is no longer stable.

</p><p align="justify">
What happens next? What happens, for example, for <i>a</i> &gt; 3 in
equation (3)?

</p><p align="justify">
To answer this question, it is helpful to look at the map which
relates the populations at successive intervals 2 generations
apart; that is, to look at the function which relates
<i>X</i><sub>t+2</sub> to <i>X</i><sub>t</sub>. 
This second iterate of equation (1) can be written

</p><p>
</p><center>
<i>X</i><sub>t+2</sub> = <i>F</i>[<i>F</i>(<i>X</i><sub>t</sub>)]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)

<p>
or, introducing an obvious piece of notation,

</p><p>
</p><center>
<i>X</i><sub>t+2</sub> = <i>F</i><sup>(2)</sup>(<i>X</i><sub>t</sub>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)
</center>

<p>

<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%203">3</a>. Clearly the 
equilibrium point <i>X</i>* of equation (5) is a solution of equation (9);
the basic fixed point of period 1 is a degenerate case of a period
2 solution. We now make a simple, but crucial, observation
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#1" target="ads_dw">1</a></sup>:
the slope of the curve <i>F</i><sup>(2)</sup><i>(X)</i> at the point
<i>X</i>*, defined as 
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(2)</sup>(<i>X</i>*)
and illustrated by the dashed lines in <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%202">Figs 2</a>
and <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%203">3</a>, is
the square of the corresponding slope of <i>F(X)</i>

</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(2)</sup> (<i>X</i>*)
= [<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(1)</sup>
(<i>X</i>*)]<sup>2</sup>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)
</center>

<p align="justify">
This fact can now be used to make plain what happens when the
fixed point <i>X</i>* becomes unstable. If the slope of <i>F(X)</i> is
less than -45° (that is,
|<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(1)</sup>| &lt; 1),
as illustrated by curve <i>a</i> in <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May2.html#Figure%201">Fig. 1</a>,
then <i>X</i>* is stable. Also, from equation (10), this implies 0 &lt;
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(2)</sup> &lt; 1
corresponding to the slope of <i>F</i><sup>(2)</sup> at <i>X</i>* lying
between 0° and 
45°, as shown in <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%202">Fig. 2</a>. As long as the
fixed point <i>X</i>* is stable, it 
provides the only non-trivial solution to equation (9). On the
other hand, when
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(1)</sup> steepens
beyond  -45° (that is, 
|<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(1)</sup>| &gt; 1),
as illustrated by curve <i>b</i> in
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May2.html#Figure%201">Fig 1</a>, <i>X</i>* becomes
unstable. At the same time, from equation (10) this implies
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(2)</sup> &gt; 1,
corresponding to the slope of <i>F</i><sup>(2)</sup> at <i>X</i>*
steepening beyond 45°, as shown in
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%203">Fig. 3</a>. As this happens, the curve 
<i>F</i><sup>(2)</sup><i>(X)</i> must develop a "loop", and two new
fixed points of 
period 2 appear, as illustrated in <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%203">Fig. 3</a>.

</p><p align="justify">
In short, as the nonlinear function <i>F(X)</i> in equation (1)
becomes more steeply humped, the basic fixed point <i>X</i>* may
become unstable. At exactly the stage when this occurs, there
are born two new and initially stable fixed points of period 2,
between which the system alternates in a stable cycle of period 2. 
The sort of graphical analysis indicated by
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May2.html#Figure%201">Figs 1</a>, <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%202">2</a> and
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%203">3</a>, along
with the equation (10), is all that is needed to establish this
generic result <sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#1" target="ads_dw">1</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#4" target="ads_dw">4</a></sup>.

</p><p align="justify">
As before, the stability of this period 2 cycle depends on the
slope of the curve <i>F</i><sup>(2)</sup><i>(X)</i> at the 2
points. (This slope is easily shown to be the same at both points
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#1" target="ads_dw">1</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#20" target="ads_dw">20</a></sup>,
and more generally to
be the same at all <i>k</i> points on a period <i>k</i> cycle.)
Furthermore, as 
is clear by imagining the intermediate stages between
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%202">Figs 2</a> and
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%203">3</a>, this stability-determining slope has the value
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"> = +1 at the
birth of the 2-point cycle, and then decreases through zero
towards <img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"> = -1 as the hump
in <i>F(X)</i> continues to steepen. 
Beyond this point the period 2 points will in turn become 
unstable, and bifurcate to give an initially stable cycle of period 4.
This in turn gives way to a cycle of period 8, and thence to a
hierarchy of bifurcating stable cycles of periods 16, 32, 64,...,
2<sup>n</sup>. In each case, the way in which a stable cycle of period
<i>k</i> 
becomes unstable, simultaneously bifurcating to produce a new
and initially stable cycle of period 2<i>k</i>, is basically similar to the
process just adumbrated for <i>k</i> = 1. A more full and rigorous
account of the material covered so far is in ref. 1.

</p><p align="justify">
This "very beautiful bifurcation phenomenon"
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#22" target="ads_dw">22</a></sup> is depicted
in <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%204">Fig. 4</a>, for the example equation (3). It
cannot be too strongly 
emphasised that the process is generic to most functions <i>F(X)</i>
with a hump of tunable steepness. Metropolis et al.

Although this process produces an infinite sequence of cycles
with periods 2<sup>n</sup> (<i>n</i> -&gt;
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/infty.gif" alt="infty">), the "window" of parameter
values 
wherein any one cycle is stable progressively diminishes, so that
the entire process is a convergent one, being bounded above by
some critical parameter value. (This is true for most, but not
all, functions <i>F(X)</i>: see equation (17) below.) This critical
parameter value is a point of accumulation of period 2<sup>n</sup> cycles.
For equation (3) it is denoted <i>a</i><sub>c</sub> :

Beyond this point of accumulation (for example, for <i>a</i> &gt;
<i>a</i><sub>c</sub> in

different periodicities, and an infinite number of different
periodic cycles. There are also an uncountable number of initial
points <i>X</i><sub>0</sub> which give totally aperiodic (although bounded)
trajectories; no matter how long the time series generated by
<i>F(X)</i> is run out, the pattern never repeats. These facts may be
established by a variety of methods

where an infinite number of different orbits can occur, has been
christened "chaotic" by Li and Yorke<sup>20</sup>.

</p><p align="justify">
As the parameter increases beyond the critical value, at first
all these cycles have even periods, with <i>X</i><sub>t</sub>
alternating up and 
down between values above, and values below, the fixed point
<i>X</i>*. Although these cycles may in fact be very complicated
(having a non-degenerate period of, say, 5,726 points before
repeating), they will seem to the casual observer to be rather like
a somewhat "noisy" cycle of period 2. As the parameter value
continues to increase, there comes a stage (at <i>a</i> = 3.6786.. for
equation (3)) at which the first odd period cycle appears. At
first these odd cycles have very long periods, but as the 
parameter value continues to increase cycles with smaller and
smaller odd periods are picked up, until at last the three-point
cycle appears (at <i>a</i> = 3.8284 . . for equation (3)). Beyond this
point, there are cycles with every integer period, as well as an
uncountable number of asymptotically aperiodic trajectories:
Li and Yorke <sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#20" target="ads_dw">20</a></sup>
entitle their original proof of this result "Period
Three Implies Chaos".

The term "chaos" evokes an image of dynamical trajectories
which are indistinguishable from some stochastic process.

of the dynamics of equation
(3), (4) and other similar equations tend to confirm this impression. 
But, for smooth and "sensible" functions <i>F(X)</i> such as in
equations (3) and (4), the underlying mathematical fact is that
for any specified parameter value there is one unique cycle that
is stable, and that attracts essentially all initial points
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#22" target="ads_dw">22</a>,

ref. 4, appendix A, for a simple and lucid exposition). That is,
there is one cycle that "owns" almost all initial points; the
remaining infinite number of other cycles, along with the
asymptotically aperiodic trajectories, own a set of points which,
although uncountable, have measure zero.

As is made clear by <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May4.html#Table%203">Tables 3</a> and
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May4.html#Table%204">4</a> below, any one particular
stable cycle is likely to occupy an extraordinarily narrow
window of parameter values. This fact, coupled with the long
time it is likely to take for transients associated with the initial
conditions to damp out, means that in practice the unique
cycle is unlikely to be unmasked, and that a stochastic description 
of the dynamics is likely to be appropriate, in spite of the
underlying deterministic structure. This point is pursued further
under the heading "practical applications", below.

</p><h3>4. FINE STRUCTURE OF THE CHAOTIC REGIME</h3>
<p align="justify">
We have seen how the original fixed point <i>X</i>* bifurcates to give
harmonics of period 2<sup>n</sup>. But how do new cycles of period <i>k</i>
arise?

</p><p align="justify">
The general process is illustrated in <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%205">Fig. 5</a>,
which shows how
period 3 cycles originate. By an obvious extension of the
notation introduced in equation (8). populations three generations 
apart are related by

</p><p>
</p><center>
<i>X</i><sub>t+3</sub> = <i>F</i><sup>(3)</sup> (<i>X</i><sub>t</sub>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)
</center>

<p align="justify">
If the hump in <i>F(X)</i> is sufficiently steep, the threefold iteration
will produce a function <i>F</i><sup>(3)</sup><i>(X)</i> with 4 humps,
as shown in 
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%205">Fig. 5</a> for the <i>F(X)</i> of equation (3). At
first (for <i>a</i> &lt; 3.8284 . . in
equation 3) the 45° line intersects this curve only at the single
point <b>X*</b> (and at <i>X</i> = 0), as shown by the solid curve in
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%205">Fig. 5</a>.
As the hump in <i>F(X)</i> steepens, the hills and valleys in <i>F</i><sup>(3)</sup><i>(X)</i>
become more pronounced, until simultaneously the first two
valleys sink and the final hill rises to touch the 45° line, and then
to intercept it at 6 new points, as shown by the dashed curve in
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%205">Fig. 5</a>. These 6 points divide into two distinct
three-point cycles. As can be made plausible by imagining the
intermediate stages in <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%205">Fig. 5</a>, it can be shown
that the stability-determining slope of 
<i>F</i><sup>(3)</sup><i>(X)</i> at three of these points has a common
value, which is 
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(3)</sup> = +1 at
their birth, and thereafter steepens beyond +1: 
this period 3 cycle is never stable. The slope of
<i>F</i><sup>(3)</sup><i>(X)</i> at the other three points begins at
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(3)</sup> = +1, and
then decreases 
towards zero, resulting in a stable cycle of period 3. As <i>F(X)</i>
continues to steepen, the slope
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(3)</sup> for this
initially stable 
three-point cycle decreases beyond -1; the cycle becomes
unstable, and gives rise by the bifurcation process discussed in
the previous section to stable cycles of period 6, 12, 24, ...,
3 × 2<sup>n</sup>. This birth of a stable and unstable pair of period 3
cycles, and the subsequent harmonics which arise as the
initially stable cycle becomes unstable, are illustrated to the right
of <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May3.html#Figure%204">Fig. 4</a>.

There are, therefore, two basic kinds of bifurcation

period <i>k</i> arise in pairs (one stable, one unstable) as the hills and
valleys of higher iterates of <i>F(X)</i> move, respectively, up and
down to intercept the 45° line, as typified by
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Figure%205">Fig. 5</a>. Such cycles
are born at the moment when the hills and valleys become
tangent to the 45° line, and the initial slope of the curve

<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May3.html#Figure%203">3</a>. This type of bifurcation may be
called a pitchfork bifurcation (borrowing an image from the

Putting all this together, we conclude that as the parameters 
in <i>F(X)</i> are varied the fundamental, stable dynamical units are
cycles of basic period <i>k</i>, which arise by tangent bifurcation,
along with their associated cascade of harmonics of periods
<i>k</i>2<sup>n</sup>, which arise by pitchfork bifurcation. On this
basis, the 
constant equilibrium solution <i>X</i>* and the subsequent hierarchy
of stable cycles of periods 2<sup>n</sup> is merely a special case, albeit a
conspicuously important one (namely <i>k</i> = 1), of a general
phenomenon. In addition, remember

<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#29" target="ads_dw">29</a></sup> that for sensible,
analytical functions (such as, for example, those in equations
(3) and (4)) there is a unique stable cycle for each value of the
parameter in <i>F(X)</i>. The entire range of parameter values
(1 &lt; <i>a</i> &lt; 4 in equation (3), 0 &lt; <i>r</i> in equation
(4)) may thus be 
regarded as made up of infinitely many windows of parameter
values - some large, some unimaginably small - each corresponding 
to a single one of these basic dynamical units.
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Table%203">Tables 3</a>
and <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Table%204">4</a>, below, illustrate this notion. These
windows are divided 
from each other by points (the points of accumulation of the
harmonics of period <i>k</i>2<sup>n</sup>) at which the system is truly
chaotic, with no attractive cycle: although there are infinitely many such
special parameter values, they have measure zero on the
interval of all values.

</p><p align="justify">
How are these various cycles arranged along the interval of
relevant parameter values? This question has to my knowledge
been answered independently by at least 6 groups of people,

A simple-minded approach (which has the advantage of
requiring little technical apparatus, and the disadvantage of
being rather clumsy) consists of first answering the question,
how many period <i>k</i> points can there be? That is, how many
distinct solutions can there be to the equation

</p><p>
</p><center>
<i>X</i>*<sub>k</sub> = <i>F</i><sup>(k)</sup> (<i>X</i>*<sub>k</sub>)?

If the function <i>F(X)</i> is sufficiently steeply humped, as it will be
once the parameter values are sufficiently large, each successive
iteration doubles the number of humps, so that
<i>F</i><sup>(k)</sup><i>(X)</i> has 
2<sup>k-1</sup> humps. For large enough parameter values, all these hills
and valleys will intersect the 45° line, producing 2<sup>k</sup>
fixed points 
of period <i>k</i>. These are listed for <i>k</i>

Such a list includes degenerate points of period <i>k</i>, whose period
is a submultiple of <i>k</i>; in particular, the two period 1 points
(<i>X</i> = 0 and <i>X</i>*) are degenerate solutions of equation (12)
for all <i>k</i>. By working from left to right across
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Table%202">Table 2</a>, these degenerate

For example, there eventually are 2<sup>6</sup> = 64 points with period
6. These include the two points of period 1, the period 2
"harmonic" cycle, and the stable and unstable pair of triplets of
points with period 3, for a total of 10 points whose basic period
is a submultiple of 6; this leaves 54 points whose basic period is 6.

</p></a><p align="justify"><a name="Table 2">
The 2<sup>k</sup> period <i>k</i> points are arranged into various cycles of
period <i>k</i>, or submultiples thereof, which appear in succession
by either tangent or pitchfork bifurcation as the parameters in

the degenerate cycles are subtracted out, to give
the total number of non-degenerate cycles of period <i>k</i>: these
numbers must equal those of the second row divided by <i>k</i>.
This fourth row includes the (stable) harmonics which arise by
pitchfork bifurcation, and the pairs of stable-unstable cycles
arising by tangent bifurcation. By subtracting out the cycles
which are unstable from birth, the total number of possible
stable cycles is given in row five; these figures can also be

cycles whose basic period is <i>k</i>.

Returning to the example of period 6, we have already noted
the five degenerate cycles whose periods are submultiples of 6.
The remaining 54 points are parcelled out into one cycle of
period 6 which arises as the harmonic of the only stable three-point 
cycle, and four distinct pairs of period 6 cycles (that is,
four initially stable ones and four unstable ones) which arise by
successive tangent bifurcations. Thus, reading from the foot of
the column for period 6 in <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May.html#Table%202">Table 2</a>, we get the

Using various labelling tricks, or techniques from combinatorial

1, 3, 4) must appear in the order 6, 5, 3, 5, 6, 6, 5, 6:

any particular function <i>F(X)</i>, the numerical task of finding the

the parameter

(2) the basic cycle becomes unstable (giving rise by successive

<title>Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics -
R.M. May</title>




</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>5. PRACTICAL PROBLEMS</h3>
<p align="justify">
Referring to the paradigmatic example of equation (3), we can
now see that the parameter interval 1 &lt; <i>a</i> &lt; 4 is made up of a
one-dimensional mosaic of infinitely many windows of <i>a</i>-values,
in each of which a unique cycle of period <i>k</i>, or one of its
harmonics, attracts essentially all initial points. Of these
windows, that for 1 &lt; <i>a</i> &lt; 3.5700 . . corresponding to
<i>k</i> = 1 and 
its harmonics is by far the widest and most conspicuous. Beyond
the first point of accumulation, it can be seen from
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May4.html#Table%203">Table 3</a> that
these windows are narrow, even for cycles of quite low periods,
and the windows rapidly become very tiny as <i>k</i> increases.

</p><p align="justify">
As a result, there develops a dichotomy between the underlying 
mathematical behaviour (which is exactly determinable)
and the "commonsense" conclusions that one would draw from
numerical simulations. If the parameter <i>a</i> is held constant at one
value in the chaotic region, and equation (3) iterated for an
arbitrarily large number of generations, a density plot of the
observed values of <i>X</i><sub>t</sub> on the interval 0 to 1 will
settle into <i>k</i> 
equal spikes (more precisely, delta functions) corresponding to
the <i>k</i> points on the stable cycle appropriate to this
<i>a</i>-value. But 
for most <i>a</i>-values this cycle will have a fairly large period, and
moreover it will typically take many thousands of generations
before the transients associated with the initial conditions are
damped out: thus the density plot produced by numerical
simulations usually looks like a sample of points taken from
some continuous distribution.

</p><p align="justify">
An especially interesting set of numerical computations are
due to Hoppensteadt (personal communication) who has
combined many iterations to produce a density plot of
<i>X</i><sub>t</sub> for 
each one of a sequence of <i>a</i>-values, gradually increasing from
3.5700 . . to 4. These results are displayed as a movie. As can
be expected from <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May4.html#Table%203">Table 3</a>, some of the
more conspicuous cycles 
do show up as sets of delta functions: the 3-cycle and its first
few harmonics; the first 5-cycle; the first 6-cycle. But for most
values of <i>a</i> the density plot looks like the sample function of a
random process. This is particularly true in the neighbourhood
of the <i>a</i>-value where the first odd cycle appears (<i>a</i> =
3.6786..), 
and again in the neighbourhood of <i>a</i> = 4: this is not surprising,
because each of these locations is a point of accumulation of
points of accumulation. Despite the underlying discontinuous
changes in the periodicities of the stable cycles, the observed
density pattern tends to vary smoothly. For example, as <i>a</i>
increases toward the value at which the 3-cycle appears, the
density plot tends to concentrate around three points, and it
smoothly diffuses away from these three points after the 3-cycle
and all its harmonics become unstable.

</p><p align="justify">
I think the most interesting mathematical problem lies in
designing a way to construct some approximate and "effectively
continuous" density spectrum, despite the fact that the exact
density function is determinable and is always a set of delta
functions. Perhaps such techniques have already been developed 
in ergodic theory
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#33" target="ads_dw">33</a></sup> (which lies
at the foundations of 
statistical mechanics), as for example in the use of "coarse-grained 
observers". I do not know.

</p><p align="justify">
Such an effectively stochastic description of the dynamical
properties of equation (4) for large <i>r</i> has been provided
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#28" target="ads_dw">28</a></sup>, albeit
by tactical tricks peculiar to that equation rather than by any
general method. As <i>r</i> increases beyond about 3, the trajectories
generated by this equation are, to an increasingly good approximation, 
almost periodic with period (1 / <i>r</i>) exp(<i>r</i> - 1).

</p><p align="justify">
The opinion I am airing in this section is that although the
exquisite fine structure of the chaotic regime is mathematically
fascinating, it is irrelevant for most practical purposes. What
seems called for is some effectively stochastic description of the
deterministic dynamics. Whereas the various statements about
the different cycles and their order of appearance can be made
in generic fashion, such stochastic description of the actual
dynamics will be quite different for different <i>F(X)</i>: witness the
difference between the behaviour of equation (4), which for
large <i>r</i> is almost periodic "outbreaks" spaced many generations
apart, versus the behaviour of equation (3), which for <i>a</i> -&gt; 4 is
not very different from a series of Bernoulli coin flips.

<title>Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics -
R.M. May</title>




</p><p>
</p><p>
<br>
<br>
</p><h3>6. MATHEMATICAL CURIOSITIES</h3>
<p align="justify">
As discussed above, the essential reason for the existence of a
succession of stable cycles throughout the "chaotic" regime is
that as each new pair of cycles is born by tangent bifurcation
(see <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May4.html#Figure%205">Fig. 5</a>), one of them is at first
stable, by virtue of the way 
the smoothly rounded hills and valleys intercept the 45° line.
For analytical functions <i>F(X)</i>, the only parameter values for
which the density plot or "invariant measure" is continuous
and truly ergodic are at the points of accumulation of
harmonics, which divide one stable cycle from the next. Such
exceptional parameter values have found applications, for
example, in the use of equation (3) with <i>a</i> = 4 as a random
number generator <sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#34" target="ads_dw">34</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#35" target="ads_dw">35</a></sup>:
it has a continuous density function
proportional to [<i>X(1 - X)</i>]<sup>-1/2</sup> in the interval 0 &lt;
<i>X</i> &lt; 1.

</p><p align="justify">
Non-analytical functions <i>F(X)</i> in which the hump is in fact a
spike provide an interesting special case. Here we may imagine
spikey hills and valleys moving to intercept the 45° line in
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May4.html#Figure%205">Fig. 5</a>,
and it may be that both the cycles born by tangent bifurcation
are unstable from the outset (one having
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(k)</sup> &gt; 1, the
other <img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(k)</sup> &lt; -1),
for all <i>k</i> &gt; 1. There are then no stable cycles in the
chaotic regime, which is therefore literally chaotic with a
continuous and truly ergodic density distribution function.

defined on the interval 0 &lt; <i>X</i> &lt; 1. For 0 &lt; <i>a</i> &lt;
1, all trajectories 
are attracted to <i>X</i> = 0; for 1 &lt; <i>a</i> &lt; 2, there are
infinitely many 
periodic orbits, along with an uncountable number of aperiodic
trajectories, none of which are locally stable. The first odd
period cycle appears at <i>a</i> =

given a careful 
discussion of the case <i>a</i> = 2. Another example, this time with an
extensive biological pedigree

a globally stable equilibrium point for

left hand half of <i>F(X)</i> flattened into a straight line. This equation
does possess windows of <i>a</i> values, each with its own stable
cycle, as described generically above. The stability-determining
slopes <img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"><sup>(k)</sup>
vary, however, discontinuously with the parameter <i>a</i>, 
and the widths of the simpler stable regions are narrower than
for equation (3): the fixed point becomes unstable at <i>a</i> = 3; the
point of accumulation of the subsequent harmonics is at
<i>a</i> = 3.27 . .; the first odd cycle appears at <i>a</i> = 3.44 . .; the
3-point cycle at <i>a</i> = 3.67. . (compare the first column in

These eccentricities of behaviour manifested by 
non-analytical functions may be of interest for exploring formal
questions in ergodic theory. I think, however, that they have no
relevance to models in the biological and social sciences, where
functions such as <i>F(X)</i> should be analytical. This view is

<title>Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics -
R.M. May</title>




</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>7. APPLICATIONS</h3>
</a><p align="justify"><a name="Figure 6">
The fact that the simple and deterministic equation (1) can
possess dynamical trajectories which look like some sort of
random noise has disturbing practical implications. It means,
for example, that apparently erratic fluctuations in the census
data for an animal population need not necessarily betoken
either the vagaries of an unpredictable environment or sampling
errors: they may simply derive from a rigidly deterministic
population growth relationship such as equation (1). This point
is discussed more fully and carefully elsewhere
<sup></sup></a><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#1" target="ads_dw">1</a>.

</p><p align="justify">
Alternatively, it may be observed that in the chaotic regime
arbitrarily close initial conditions can lead to trajectories
which, after a sufficiently long time, diverge widely. This means
that, even if we have a simple model in which all the parameters
are determined exactly, long term prediction is nevertheless
impossible. In a meteorological context, Lorenz
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#15" target="ads_dw">15</a></sup> has called
this general phenomenon the "butterfly effect": even if the
atmosphere could be described by a deterministic model in
which all parameters were known, the fluttering of a butterfly's
wings could alter the initial conditions, and thus (in the chaotic
regime) alter the long term prediction.

</p><p align="justify">
Fluid turbulence provides a classic example where, as a
parameter (the Reynolds number) is tuned in a set of deterministic 
equations (the Navier-Stokes equations), the motion
can undergo an abrupt transition from some stable configuration 
(for example, laminar flow) into an apparently stochastic,
chaotic regime. Various models, based on the Navier-Stokes
differential equations, have been proposed as mathematical
metaphors for this process
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#15" target="ads_dw">15</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#40" target="ads_dw">40</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#41" target="ads_dw">41</a></sup>. In a recent
review of the theory of turbulence, Martin
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#42" target="ads_dw">42</a></sup> has
observed that the  
one-dimensional difference equation (1) may be useful in this
context. Compared with the earlier models
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#15" target="ads_dw">15</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#40" target="ads_dw">40</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#41" target="ads_dw">41</a></sup>, it has the
disadvantage of being even more abstractly metaphorical, and
the advantage of having a spectrum of dynamical behaviour
which is more richly complicated yet more amenable to
analytical investigation.

</p><p align="justify">
A more down-to-earth application is possible in the use of
equation (1) to fit data

on biological populations
with discrete, non-overlapping generations, as is the case for
many temperate zone arthropods. <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May6.html#Figure%206">Figure 6</a>
shows the parameter values <img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda">
and <img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/beta.gif" alt="beta"> that are
estimated <sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#39" target="ads_dw">39</a></sup>
for 24 natural populations 
and 4 laboratory populations when equation (17) is fitted to the
available data. The figure also shows the theoretical stability
domains: a stable point; its stable harmonics (stable cycles of
period 2<sup>n</sup>); chaos. The natural populations tend to have stable
equilibrium point behaviour. The laboratory populations tend
to show oscillatory or chaotic behaviour; their behaviour may
be exaggeratedly nonlinear because of the absence, in a
laboratory setting, of many natural mortality factors. It is
perhaps suggestive that the most oscillatory natural population
(labelled <i>A</i> in <a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May6.html#Figure%206">Fig. 6</a>) is the
Colorado potato beetle, whose 
present relationship with its host plant lacks an evolutionary
pedigree. These remarks are only tentative, and must be treated
with caution for several reasons. Two of the main caveats are
that there are technical difficulties in selecting and reducing the
data, and that there are no single species populations in the
natural world: to obtain a one-dimensional difference equation
by replacing a population's interactions with its biological and
physical environment by passive parameters (such as
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"> and
<img src="./Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics - R.May_files/beta.gif" alt="beta">)
may do great violence to the reality.

applications were alluded to in the second section, above

One aim of this review article is to provoke applications in yet
other fields.

<title>Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics -
R.M. May</title>




</p><p>
</p><p>
<br>
<br>
</p><h3>8. RELATED PHENOMENA IN HIGHER DIMENSIONS</h3>
<p align="justify">
Pairs of coupled, first-order difference equations (equivalent to
a single second-order equation) have been investigated in
several contexts <sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#4" target="ads_dw">4</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#44" target="ads_dw">44</a> -
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#46" target="ads_dw">46</a></sup>,
particularly in the study of temperate
zone arthropod prey-predator systems
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#2" target="ads_dw">2</a> -
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#4" target="ads_dw">4</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#23" target="ads_dw">23</a>,
<a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#47" target="ads_dw">47</a></sup>. In these 
two-dimensional systems, the complications in the dynamical
behaviour are further compounded by such facts as: (1) even
for analytical functions, there can be truly chaotic behaviour
(as for equations (14) and (15)), corresponding to so-called
"strange attractors"; and (2) two or more different stable states
(for example, a stable point and a stable cycle of period 3) can
occur together for the same parameter values
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#4" target="ads_dw">4</a></sup>. In addition, the
manifestation of these phenomena usually requires less severe
nonlinearities (less steeply humped <i>F(X)</i>) than for the 
one-dimensional case.

</p><p align="justify">
Similar systems of first-order ordinary differential equations,
or two coupled first-order differential equations, have much
simpler dynamical behaviour, made up of stable and unstable
points and limit cycles
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#48" target="ads_dw">48</a></sup>. This is
basically because in continuous 
two-dimensional systems the inside and outside of closed curves
can be distinguished; dynamic trajectories cannot cross each
other. The situation becomes qualitatively more complicated
and in many ways analogous to first-order difference equations
when one moves to systems of three or more coupled, first-order
ordinary differential equations (that is, three-dimensional
systems of ordinary differential equations). Scanlon (personal
communication) has argued that chaotic behaviour and
"strange attractors", that is solutions which are neither points
nor periodic orbits
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#48" target="ads_dw">48</a></sup>, are
typical of such systems. Some well 
studied examples arise in models for reaction-diffusion systems
in chemistry and biology
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#49" target="ads_dw">49</a></sup>, and in the
models of Lorenz
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#15" target="ads_dw">15</a></sup>
(three dimensions) and Ruelle and Takens
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#40" target="ads_dw">40</a></sup> (four
dimensions) 
referred to above. The analysis of these systems is, by virtue
of their higher dimensionality, much less transparent than for
equation (1).

</p><p align="justify">
An explicit and rather surprising example of a system which
has recently been studied from this viewpoint is the ordinary
differential equations used in ecology to describe competing
species. For one or two species these systems are very tame:
dynamic trajectories will converge on some stable equilibrium
point (which may represent coexistence, or one or both species
becoming extinct). As Smale
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#50" target="ads_dw">50</a></sup> has
recently shown, however, 
for 3 or more species these general equations can, in a certain
reasonable and well-defined sense, be compatible with any
dynamical behaviour. Smale's
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#50" target="ads_dw">50</a></sup> discussion
is generic and 
abstract: a specific study of the very peculiar dynamics which
can be exhibited by the familiar Lotka-Volterra equations
once there are 3 competitors is given by May and Leonard
<sup><a href="https://carretero.sdsu.edu/teaching/M-538/lectures/references/May/May_refs.html#51" target="ads_dw">51</a></sup>.
