I am going to find solutions to the NLS:

To numerically solve the Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger Equation (NLS) and find specific solutions like Bright and Dark Solitons, I will employ a combination of numerical methods. For spatial discretization, I will utilize a Fourier spectral method, leveraging the efficiency of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to represent the solution on a grid of points. To handle the temporal evolution, I will implement a time-splitting method, such as the Strang splitting scheme. To optimize the initial conditions and parameters of the NLS equation to obtain desired soliton solutions, I will use gradient descent and Newton's method. By carefully balancing these numerical techniques, I aim to accurately simulate and analyze the dynamics of these nonlinear wave phenomena.
