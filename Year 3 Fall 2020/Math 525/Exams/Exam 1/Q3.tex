		\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
			\item An error pattern of weight $d$ that $C$ does not detect.
			\\ \\
			Given that $C$ is defined as below:
			\[C = \{001100,110111,011001,100010\}\]
			I was able to see the distance from $u = 001100$ to $v = 011001$ was $d(u,v) = 3$.  There is an error pattern $e$ of weight $d$ that can be defined as below:
			\[e = u + w = 010101\]
			Thus we have an error pattern of weight $d = 3$, that is not detectable by $C$
			\\ \\
			\item An error pattern of weight $\lfloor \frac{d-1}{2}\rfloor + 1$ that $C$ does not correct.
			\\ \\
			I was able to see the distance from $u = 001100$ to $v = 011001$ was $d(u,v) = 3$. Notice that with $d = 3$, $\lfloor \frac{d-1}{2}\rfloor + 1 = 2$.  So I need to find an error pattern of weight 2, that $C$ does not correct.  Because $d(u,v) = 3$, if I make an error pattern of weight 2 and add it to $u$, the result $u + e$ will be closer to $v$. So let $e = 010100$ such that  
			\[w = u + e = 011000\]
			Now notice that $d(w,u) = 2$ but the $d(w,v) = 1$.  So $C$ will not correct $e = 010100$.
